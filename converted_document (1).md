__Types of Mechanoreceptors in the Human Hand's Glabrous Skin:__

1. Merkel Cells and SA I Afferents:
	- Associated with fine spatial detail sensitivity
	- Linear response to skin indentations
	- Maximally sensitive to low vibrotactile frequencies \(0\.4 to 3 Hz\)
2. Meissner's Corpuscles and FA I Afferents:
	- Even response across their receptive field
	- Sensitive to transient deformation and low\-frequency vibration
	- Maximally sensitive to vibrotactile frequencies \(3 to 40 Hz\)
3. Ruffini Endings and SA II Afferents:
	- Receptive fields about five times larger than SA I units
	- Most sensitive to vibrotactile frequencies \(100 to >500 Hz\)
