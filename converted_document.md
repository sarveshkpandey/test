Types of Mechanoreceptors in the Human Hand's Glabrous Skin:

1. Merkel Cells and SA I Afferents:
	- Associated with fine spatial detail sensitivity
	- Linear response to skin indentations
	- Maximally sensitive to low vibrotactile frequencies \(0\.4 to 3 Hz\)
2. Meissner's Corpuscles and FA I Afferents:
	- Even response across their receptive field
	- Sensitive to transient deformation and low\-frequency vibration
	- Maximally sensitive to vibrotactile frequencies \(3 to 40 Hz\)
3. Ruffini Endings and SA II Afferents:
	- Receptive fields about five times larger than SA I units
	- Most sensitive to vibrotactile frequencies \(100 to >500 Hz\)
4. Pacinian Corpuscles and FA II Afferents:
	- Exquisitely sensitive to transient stimulation, including vibration
	- Maximally sensitive to vibrotactile frequencies \(40 to >500 Hz\)

The mechanoreceptors in hairy skin can be categorized as follows:

1. Merkel Cells and SA I Receptors:
	- Found within the epidermis
	- Responsible for detecting fine spatial detail
	- Grouped under touch domes with a single afferent for many receptors
2. Ruffini Endings and SA II Receptors:
	- Typically located around hair follicles
	- Classified based on rapidly adapting responses and multiple spots with high sensitivity within their receptive fields
3. Hair\-Follicle Receptors, Field Units, and Pacinian Corpuscles:
	- Hair\-follicle receptors respond briskly to hair movements and light air puffs
	- Field units are not sensitive to hair movements and have rapidly adapting responses
	- Pacinian corpuscles are rare in hairy skin and are found near joints, tendon sheaths, and interosseous membranes
4. Unmyelinated Tactile Units:
	- Exist in hairy skin with low thresholds to mechanical stimuli
	- May be linked to the affective aspects of touch, known as "limbic touch"

The neurophysiological studies indicate that hairy skin uses three channels to mediate mechanoreception—NPh low, NPh mid, and P channels—each neurally controlled by a separate mechanoreceptor population, reflecting differences from glabrous skin in mechanoreceptor responses to mechanical events\. Furthermore, hairy skin can signal mechanical events differently from glabrous skin due to variations in innervation density, response properties of mechanoreceptors, and possibly in the mechanical coupling of the skin and stimulator\.

Overall, the mechanoreceptors in hairy skin respond to mechanical deformation and discharge in response to finger movements, contributing to proprioceptive information and influencing various levels of the motor system\. It is also suggested that the traditional view of a one\-receptor/one\-fiber association may oversimplify the innervation and function of mechanoreceptors\.

Thermoreceptors in the skin can be generalized as follows:

1. Cold Receptors:
	- Respond to decreases in temperature \(5–43°C\)
	- Most vigorous discharge at skin temperatures of 25°C
	- More numerous than warm receptors
2. Warm Receptors:
	- Discharge with increasing skin temperature
	- Reach maximum discharge around 45°C
	- Spontaneous firing even at skin temperatures of 30–36°C
3. Thermal Sensations and Pain:
	- Thermal information is transmitted by thermal nociceptors if the temperature surpasses 45°C or drops below 13°C
	- Extreme temperatures can signal tissue damage, transitioning from thermal sensation to pain
4. Innervation Density and Conduction Velocities:
	- Estimated innervation density of cold and warm fibers in the glabrous skin of the hand is approximately 50–70 fibers/cm²
	- Afferent fibers innervating warm receptors have conduction velocities of 1–2 m/s \(unmyelinated fibers\)
	- Afferent fibers innervating cold receptors have conduction velocities of 10–20 m/s \(small\-diameter myelinated fibers\)

Nociceptors in the skin are specialized afferent units that are selectively sensitive to high\-intensity stimulation of various energy forms \(e\.g\., electrical, mechanical, chemical, or thermal\) that can cause tissue damage\. These nociceptors play a crucial role in signaling potential harm to the body\.

The muscle receptors can be summarized as follows:

1\. Muscle Spindles \(Stretch Receptors\):

   \- Composed of primary and secondary spindle receptors

   \- Located in parallel to extrafusal muscle fibers

   \- Vital in detecting changes in muscle length and velocity of contraction

   \- Primary spindle receptors are highly responsive to stretch velocity, while secondary spindle receptors provide information about static muscle length or limb position

2\. Golgi Tendon Organs:

   \- Sensitively respond to forces developed by extrafusal muscle fibers

   \- Less numerous and variable compared to muscle spindles

   \- Provide an overall measure of muscle tension

3\. Information Processing:

   \- Convey essential information regarding muscle length, changes in muscle length, and forces generated by muscles

   \- Contribute to the perception of finger movements, static hand position, estimation of object weight and compliance, and limb position and movement

4\. Peripheral and Central Feedback:

   \- Cutaneous afferents from the hand and central feedback, such as corollary discharges, also play a role in proprioception

   \- Central feedback is used to decode spindle afferent signals and perceive force

These receptors provide imperative proprioceptive information that enables the body to sense and react to changes in muscle length, muscle forces, and limb positions\.

The joint receptors in the proximity of joint capsules can be summarized as follows:

1. Types of Receptors:
	- Ruffini endings, Golgi endings, Paciniform endings, and free nerve endings are found in and around joint capsules
	- Paciniform endings are likely rapidly adapting, while Ruffini and Golgi endings are probably slowly adapting
2. Function and Response:
	- Articular receptors discharge near the extremes of joint movement and often remain active during both extreme flexion and extension, thus not providing a clear signal related to joint position
	- Midrange joint receptors respond to finger movements throughout the physiological range of joint rotation and provide some kinematic information, although their capacity to signal the direction of joint movement is limited
3. Contribution to Proprioception:
	- Joint afferent input may be significant when muscle spindle afferents cannot contribute to proprioception, such as in conditions where muscle receptors are not engaged
	- Studies suggest that the information conveyed by joint receptors can be duplicated by other sensory sources such as muscle spindles

These joint receptors play a role in providing proprioceptive feedback, particularly in situations where muscle receptors are not contributing to proprioception\. They contribute to the body's ability to detect joint movements and positions, especially in the absence of muscle receptor input\.
